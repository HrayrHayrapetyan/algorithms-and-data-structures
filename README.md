## **Usage**

1. Navigate to the desired folder (e.g., `data-structures/` or `leetcode-solutions/`).  
2. Open the file you want to run or study.  
3. Run the program using the relevant command. For example, if the file is in Python:
   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```

### Example Usage
**Running a Singly Linked List Implementation:**
```bash
cd data-structures/linked-list
python singly_linked_list.py
```

**Testing a LeetCode Problem Solution:**
```bash
cd leetcode-solutions
python two_sum.py
```
